## 1. Colab Pros

- Colab is essentially a Jupyter notebook in the cloud, run on Googleâ€™s servers â€” no local setup required.
- Free access to GPUs/TPUs for quick experiments.
- Easy sharing and collaboration; integrates seamlessly with Google Drive.

## 2. Colab Cons

- Limited session durations and automatic disconnection after idle time.
- Shared compute resources â€” GPU/TPU access may be throttled.
- No persistent storage; data is lost once the session ends.
- Not well-suited for long-term or large-scale machine learning workflows.

## 3. Freemium Tiers

- **Free tier**: Best for short-term experiments or learning environments.
- **Pro ($9.99/month)**: Greater access to compute resources; good for moderate workloads.
- **Pro+ ($49.99/month)**: Designed for high-demand workflows requiring more stable, faster GPU/TPU access.

> ðŸ’¡ While a Pro+ subscription provides convenience, many ML/AI workloads can be run on AWS for less than $50/month â€” making it a compelling alternative if you need persistent compute and more control.

## 4. When to Use Colab vs. AWS/CHTC

- **Use Colab** for:
  - Quick testing and prototyping
  - Learning and teaching ML/AI
  - Small-scale experiments

- **Use AWS SageMaker** for:
  - Complex ML workflows and large-scale experimentation
  - High-throughput training (e.g., parallel hyperparameter tuning)
  - Research use cases that demand scalability, versioning, and control

- **Use CHTC (UW-Madison only)** for:
  - Free, persistent GPU compute
  - Long-running training tasks on high-performance infrastructure
