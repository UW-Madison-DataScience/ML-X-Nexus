## About this resource
<!-- MARKDOWN COMMENT: Replace the instructions below with your resource description -->
[One Useful Thing](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/) is a blog where Wharton professor Ethan Mollick "provides a research-based view on the implications of AI." Since November 2022 Mollick has been sharing a new post  several times a month, reflecting on the impacts of consumer-facing LLMs throughout society, but especially in the workplace. 

Topics range from practical advice on how to encourage adoption of AI in the workplace, to reflections on AI ethics questions, to in-depth studies of the abilities and limitations of consumer-facing AI products, to futurist explorations of the potential impacts of AI.
