    "> I demo'd this notebook at [ML+Coffee](https://hub.datascience.wisc.edu/communities/mlx/#mlcoffee) on May 7, 2025.  It's an early work in progress, but I hope it's still useful in its current state! I plan to integrate this tutorial into either our [Intro to NLP workshop](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Learn/Workshops/Intro-TextAnalysis_Python.html) or into a new workshop focused on advanced language-model pipelines. Stay tuned — and subscribe to the [ML+X Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/g-groups.wisc.edu/g/ml-community-of-practice) to stay informed about updates and new workshops.\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates the use of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to answer factual questions from Shakespeare's *Romeo and Juliet*. Our long-term goal is to build a RAG-powered chatbot that supports literary exploration—helping readers investigate character dynamics, thematic development, and emotional subtext.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first part of the demo, we focus on low-hanging fruit: factual, quote-supported questions that a RAG pipeline can answer reliably. These examples will help us introduce key RAG components, and set a performance baseline before tackling more interpretive questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify the key components of a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.\n",
    "- Use a sentence-transformer model to create embeddings from text passages.\n",
    "- Run simple retrieval using vector similarity and evaluate retrieved chunks.\n",
    "- Generate answers to factual questions using retrieved content as context.\n",
    "- Understand early limitations of RAG pipelines and motivate future improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-step overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the corpus**\n",
    "   - We use Shakespeare texts from the workshop's `data.csv` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Split text into chunks**\n",
    "   - Long texts are broken into smaller passages (~200 words) so they're easier to search and analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create embeddings**\n",
    "   - Each chunk is converted into a vector — a mathematical representation of its meaning — using a pretrained model from `sentence-transformers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Retrieve relevant chunks**\n",
    "   - When you ask a question, we embed the question and compare it to the embedded text chunks to find the most similar passages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ask a language model**\n",
    "   - We take the most relevant passages and feed them (along with your question) into a pretrained language model (like GPT-2) to generate an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not training a model from scratch — it's a lightweight, modular way to build smart question-answering tools on top of your own text collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore the strengths and limitations of this approach along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Load the corpus\n",

    "## Step 3: Embed chunks with sentence transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable semantic search, we need to convert our text chunks into numerical vectors—high-dimensional representations that capture meaning beyond simple keyword overlap. This process is called *embedding*, and it allows us to compare the semantic similarity between a user's question and the contents of a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done using an **encoder-only transformer model**. Unlike decoder or encoder-decoder models, encoder-only models are not designed to generate text. Instead, they are optimized for understanding input sequences and producing meaningful vector representations. These models take in text and output fixed-size embeddings that capture semantic content—ideal for tasks like search, retrieval, and clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The [`sentence-transformers`](https://www.sbert.net/) library  \n",
    "  - A widely used library that wraps encoder-only transformer models for generating sentence- and paragraph-level embeddings.\n",
    "  - It provides a simple interface (`model.encode()`) and is optimized for performance and batching, making it well-suited for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows.\n",
    "  - It supports both short queries and longer document chunks, embedding them into the same shared vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A pretrained model: [`multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1`](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1)  \n",
    "  - A compact encoder-only model (6 layers) designed for semantic search and question answering.\n",
    "  - Trained using contrastive learning on query-passage pairs, so it learns to embed related questions and answers close together in vector space.\n",
    "  - It's efficient enough to run on CPUs or entry-level GPUs, making it great for experimentation and prototyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why embeddings matter in RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "In a RAG system, embeddings are the foundation for connecting a user's question to the most relevant content in your corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than relying on exact keyword matches, embeddings represent both queries and document chunks in the same semantic space. When a user asks a question, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert the user's question into a vector using the same encoder-only embedding model that was used to encode the document chunks.\n",
    "2. Compute similarity scores (e.g., cosine similarity) between the query vector and each chunk vector.\n",
    "3. Retrieve the top-matching chunks to pass along as context to the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the system to surface text that is meaningfully related to the question—even if it doesn't use the same words. For example, a question like \"*What does Juliet think of Romeo?*\" might retrieve a passage describing her inner turmoil or emotional reaction, even if the words \"think\" or \"Romeo\" aren't explicitly present. Embedding-based retrieval improves relevance, flexibility, and ultimately the quality of the answers your language model can generate."

    "\n",

    "- We take the user's question and convert it into a vector embedding using the *same model* we used to embed the original text chunks.\n",

    "\n",
    "We're assuming that the embedding model (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) was trained in such a way that *questions and answers occupy the same semantic space*. That is, if a question and a passage are semantically aligned (e.g., about the same topic or fact), their embeddings should be close. This assumption holds reasonably well for general-purpose models trained on sentence pairs, but it's not perfect — especially for very abstract or indirect questions. If a model was only trained to embed statements, it may not align questions correctly. You might retrieve chunks that are **related but not directly useful** for answering the question."

    "\n",
    "The following output shows how a RAG system handles the factual question \"Who kills Mercutio?\" using a chunked version of *Romeo and Juliet*. While no chunk explicitly states \"Tybalt kills Mercutio\" in modern phrasing, the system successfully retrieves highly relevant context. The Project Gutenberg edition uses the older spelling \"Tibalt\", which the retriever still resolves semantically.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Chunk 1** is the most direct and useful. It captures the aftermath of the duel, with citizens exclaiming:\n",
    "  * \"*Which way ran he that kild Mercutio? Tibalt that Murtherer, which way ran he?*\". Despite the archaic spelling and phrasing, this chunk effectively provides the answer when interpreted in context.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Chunk 2** sets up the conflict. It includes Mercutio and Benvolio discussing that:\n",
    "  * \"*Tibalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, hath sent a Letter*\" ... \"*A challenge on my life*\". While it doesn't answer the question directly, it reinforces that Tibalt is the antagonist and establishes his role in escalating the violence.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Chunk 3** presents the Prince's legal judgment:\n",
    "  * \"*Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutios Friend… The life of Tibalt*.\" The Prince confirms that Tybalt (Tibalt) has been killed in consequence of Mercutio's death. This chunk emphasizes closure rather than causality, but still supports the factual chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Early modern spelling (e.g., *Tibalt*) doesn't hinder embedding-based retrieval — a strength of semantic models.\n",

    "- The system retrieves scenes with narrative and legal resolution, not just the killing itself.\n",

    "### Improving retrieved chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move on to having a language model generate answers, we need to take a closer look at the quality of the retrieved content.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we just saw, our current retrieval method brings back passages that are topically related but often miss the actual moment where the answer appears. In some cases, the correct chunk is nearby but not retrieved. In others, key information may be split across multiple chunks or surrounded by distracting dialogue.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we'll focus on a key area of improvement: **refining the chunking strategy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why chunking matters\n",
    "\n",
    "The current approach uses a simple method such as splitting the text by a fixed word count. While this works for general purposes, it often cuts across meaningful dramatic units:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A character's speech may be interrupted mid-line\n",
    "- A fight scene may be split just before or after a critical action\n",
    "- A conversation between characters may be split across chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to less coherent retrieval and lowers the chance that a single chunk can fully answer the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two practical adjustments we can use to improve the retrievals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Group complete speaker turns into chunks**: Instead of arbitrary lengths, we can group text based on who is speaking. This ensures each chunk preserves the flow and tone of the conversation.\n",
    "2. **Use scene- or event-aware chunking**: By chunking based on scene boundaries or key events (e.g. \"Romeo kills Tybalt\"), we improve the chance that retrieved content captures complete dramatic moments, not just pieces of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "These changes don't require a new model—they just help the existing model work with more meaningful input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll apply dialogue-aware chunking and rerun one of our earlier factual queries to see whether the results improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Refining chunking strategy\n",
    "Our current chunks are only based on word length. Instead, we can create chunks that are more tuned to the dataset and potential questions we might ask by defining a chunk as a \"dialogue block\", i.e.,  as a group of N full speaker turns (e.g., JULIET. + her lines, ROMEO. + his lines, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's give this a shot to see how it impacts retrieval."

    "### Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Refining our chunking strategy to preserve full speaker turns—and grouping several turns together—has already improved the relevance of the chunks retrieved. The content is more coherent, more complete, and better aligned with the structure of a play. This shows how much retrieval quality depends not just on the model, but on the way we prepare and represent the source material.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, even with better chunks, retrieval doesn't always land on the exact moment that answers the question. Sometimes it gets close but stops short; other times it picks up a scene with similar characters or themes, but not the one we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "This points to a deeper challenge: *semantic similarity alone doesn't always capture answer relevance*. The chunk that's closest in meaning isn't always the one that answers the question. One way to address this is through a process called **reranking**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is reranking?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reranking means retrieving a small set of candidate chunks—say, the top 5—and then using an additional method to determine which of those is the best fit for the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "That method could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A custom scoring function (e.g., based on keyword overlap, speaker identity, or chunk metadata),\n",
    "- Or—more powerfully—a *separate language model*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This separate model can be small or large, depending on your resource availability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A smaller open-source model (like `mistral`, `falcon`, or `phi`) can often handle basic ranking tasks at low cost.\n",
    "- A larger LLM (like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) may be better at reasoning through subtleties and weighing relevance when answers are indirect or distributed across lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might ask this model something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Here are three passages. Which one best answers the question: \"Who kills Mercutio?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, it might feel strange to use one language model to support another—but this layered setup is common in production RAG pipelines. It separates concerns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The retriever quickly narrows down the universe of text,\n",
    "- The reranker evaluates those chunks more deeply, focusing on which is most likely to be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't implement this yet, but it's worth introducing now. As we start exploring more ambiguous or emotionally driven questions in later sections, reranking becomes one of the key techniques for bridging the gap between retrieval and meaningful response.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we've established a strong foundation: well-structured chunks that carry clear speaker information and preserve narrative flow. That's a critical step toward building a RAG system that doesn't just respond, but interprets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Upgrading our retrieval model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model we've used so far, [`multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1`](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1), is a solid starting point for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, it is relatively lightweight (22M parameters, ~500–800 MB GPU memory), which makes it efficient but less expressive than larger models.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, larger embedding models have more capacity to capture subtle semantic relationships, including indirect phrasing or domain-specific language. This can make a dramatic difference in tasks like matching Shakespearean dialogue to modern questions—something smaller models often struggle with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try a slightly larger model with 109 M parameters, [`all-mpnet-base-v2`](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2)"

    "\n",
    "**For retrieval**, we explored and discussed improvements such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using stronger embedding models (e.g., upgrading from `MiniLM` to `all-mpnet-base-v2`).\n",
    "- Adopting a question-aligned chunking strategy, where chunks were grouped by speaker turns to better match the structure of expected queries.\n",
    "- Implementing cosine similarity retrieval, which better handles variation in chunk lengths and embedding magnitudes.\n",
    "- Briefly mentioning reranking as a next step, though not yet implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For generation**, we found that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instruction-tuned language models yield more precise and context-sensitive answers.\n",
    "- Prompt formatting significantly affects the clarity and relevance of the generated output.\n",
    "- Post-processing may be necessary for trimming or cleaning model responses, especially in short-form QA tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "While larger models consistently improve both retrieval and generation, thoughtful design choices—such as aligning chunk structure to question types, using the right embedding normalization, and writing effective prompts—can yield substantial gains, even in smaller pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a first step in a broader RAG workflow. Future notebooks will experiment with more flexible chunking, incorporate reranking, and test the system’s ability to handle interpretive or subjective questions."
