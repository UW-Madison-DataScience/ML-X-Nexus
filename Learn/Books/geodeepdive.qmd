## Overview

GeoDeepDive (GDD) is a cyberinfrastructure project designed to accelerate scientific discovery by extracting information from the vast and growing body of published scientific literature. While its roots are in geology, its applications span any domain that relies on published texts, including biology, materials science, medicine, and social sciences.

At its core, GDD is a massive database of over 15 million scientific documents (articles, theses, reports) that have been processed through a high-performance computing pipeline. This pipeline performs:
*   **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** to convert scanned PDFs into machine-readable text.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to parse sentences, identify parts of speech, and perform named entity recognition (e.g., finding mineral names, locations, species).
*   **Relation Extraction** to find and catalog relationships between entities (e.g., "mineral X is found at location Y").

The result is not just a collection of texts, but a structured, queryable knowledge graph. Researchers can use GDD's public API to ask complex questions that would be impossible to answer by manual literature review, such as "find all papers that mention a specific fossil and its geological age" or "extract all measured values of a particular chemical compound."

## Prerequisites

*   **Basic familiarity with Python** and making HTTP requests.
*   A **GitHub account** (to use GDD's public API).
*   An understanding of basic **NLP concepts** (Token, Sentence, Named Entity) is helpful but not strictly required to run the example.

## Key Concepts and Definitions

| Concept | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Document** | Any processed text unit in the GDD database, typically a scientific publication. |
| **NLP** | Natural Language Processing, the field of AI concerned with interactions between computers and human language. |
| **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** | An NLP task to identify and classify key information (entities) in text into predefined categories like persons, organizations, locations, etc. In GDD, these are often scientific terms. |
| **API (Application Programming Interface)** | A set of rules and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. GDD provides an API to query its database programmatically. |
| **JSON** | JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and for machines to parse and generate. It is the primary format for data returned by the GDD API. |

## Tutorial: Querying the GeoDeepDive API for Mineral Mentions

This tutorial will guide you through a simple example of using Python to query the GeoDeepDive API to find sentences that mention the mineral "stishovite."

### Step 1: Get Your GitHub Token
The GDD API uses GitHub OAuth for authentication. You need to generate a personal access token.
1.  Go to your GitHub [Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile).
2.  Navigate to **Developer settings** > **Personal access tokens** > **Tokens (classic)**.
3.  Click **Generate new token (classic)**. Give it a descriptive note (e.g., "GeoDeepDive API").
4.  Select the `public_repo` scope. This is sufficient.
5.  Click **Generate token** and **copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again!).

### Step 2: Set Up Your Python Environment
We'll use the `requests` library to make HTTP calls. Install it if you don't have it.
```bash
pip install requests
```

### Step 3: Write the Query Script
Create a new Python script (`gdd_query.py`) and paste the following code. **Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN` with the token you just copied.**

```python
import requests
import json

# Your GitHub credentials for the GDD API
username = "YourGitHubUsername" 
token = "YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN"     

# The public endpoint for the GDD API
url = "https://geodeepdive.org/api/articles"

# The parameters for our query. We want sentences about 'stishovite'
params = {
    "term": "stishovite",   # The word or phrase to search for
    "full_results": True,   # Get full details, including sentences
    "sentences": True       # Include the sentences in the response
}

# Make the GET request to the API with authentication
response = requests.get(url, params=params, auth=(username, token))

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print(f"Found {data['success']['total']} documents mentioning 'stishovite'.\n")

    # Loop through the first few documents and print relevant sentences
    for doc in data['success']['data'][:2]:  # Look at first 2 docs
        print(f"Document: {doc['_gddid']} ({doc['title']})")
        print("Sentences found:")
        for sentence in doc['sentences']:
            # Print the sentence that contains the term
            if 'stishovite' in sentence['text'].lower():
                print(f"  - {sentence['text']}")
        print("\n" + "-"*80 + "\n")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
    print(response.text)
```

### Step 4: Run the Script and Interpret the Results
Run the script from your terminal:
```bash
python gdd_query.py
```

You should see an output that looks something like this:
```
Found 142 documents mentioning 'stishovite'.

Document: 5505a5ebb9a2cda414b2b7d4 (Shock metamorphism of quartz in nature and experiment: II. Significance in geoscience)
Sentences found:
  - The very high pressure polymorphs stishovite and coesite are preserved indefinitely at surface conditions although both are thermodynamically unstable relative to quartz.
  - Stishovite and coesite are, however, uniquely identified by their crystal structure and thus are the only reliable and unambiguous indicators of shock metamorphism and, by inference, impact cratering.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Document: 5505a5ebb9a2cda414b2b7d5 (Localized shock- induced melting in l chondrites: Evidence from the sixiangkou meteorite)
Sentences found:
  - The presence of solid state crystals of stishovite in the melt portion of a dark vein and the occurrence of ringwoodite and majorite in the same vein indicate a pressure of 13- 16 GPa and a temperature of 2000 " C.
...
```
The script tells you how many documents were found and shows you the exact sentences from those documents where the term "stishovite" appears, providing immediate context for your research.

## Summary

GeoDeepDive is a powerful tool for moving beyond simple keyword searches to true knowledge extraction. By providing programmatic access to a deeply processed corpus of scientific literature, it enables researchers to ask complex, data-driven questions at a scale that was previously impossible.

*   **Key Takeaway:** GDD turns unstructured text into structured, queryable data.
*   **Next Steps:** Explore the [official GeoDeepDive API documentation](https://geodeepdive.org/api_help) to learn about more advanced queries, such as filtering by author, journal, or year, and using its relation extraction capabilities.
