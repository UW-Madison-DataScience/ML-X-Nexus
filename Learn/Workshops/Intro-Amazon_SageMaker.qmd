## About this resource
This introductory [Amazon SageMaker workshop](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML_with_Amazon_SageMaker/index.html) teaches core workflows for running predictive ML/AI models in Amazon SageMaker, an AWS-managed machine learning environment. Participants will learn to set up data, configure SageMaker Notebooks, manage code repositories, train and tune models, and optimize resource costs effectively within AWS. While currently tailored for 2024 Machine Learning Marathon participants, a more general version of the materials will be released in the coming months. The lesson is in the **pre-alpha phase**, meaning it is under development and has not yet been taught. Users will benefit from tips on controlling AWS expenses and scaling models efficiently, with real-world guidance on choosing appropriate CPU and GPU resources.

#### Cost estimate
Running through this workshop should cost approximately **$10-$15** on AWS, assuming moderate usage of GPU instances and a few parallel jobs. For new AWS accounts, the **AWS Free Tier** may cover some of these costs, including 250 hours per month of the `ml.t2.medium` instance for the first two months, as well as some limited S3 storage. This means new users may be able to complete certain parts of the workshop for free or at a significantly reduced cost. We recommend monitoring usage through the AWS Billing Dashboard to stay within the free tier and manage any extra expenses effectively.

#### Prerequisites
- [Intro to Machine Learning](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Learn/Workshops/Intro-ML_Sklearn.html)
- [Basic Python Programming](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Learn/Workshops/Intro-Python_Gapminder.html)

#### Estimated time to complete 
**3-5 hours**: Based on running through training, tuning, and experimenting with example code setups.
