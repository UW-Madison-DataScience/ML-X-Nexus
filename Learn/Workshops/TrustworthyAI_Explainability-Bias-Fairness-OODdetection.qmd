## About this resource

The [Trustworthy AI: Explainability, Bias, Fairness, and Safety](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/fair-explainable-ml/index.html) workshop equips participants with practical skills to evaluate and improve the trustworthiness of machine learning models. Spanning structured data (tabular), natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision applications, this workshop integrates tools and techniques to enhance fairness, explainability, and reliability. Participants will explore real-world applications using cutting-edge libraries like [AIF360](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Toolbox/Libraries/AI-Fairness-360.html), [PyTorch-OOD](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Toolbox/Libraries/PyTorch-OOD.html), and GradCAM. 

The lesson is now in the **alpha phase**, meaning it has been piloted and is ready for broader use and feedback. Materials may continue to evolve with additional topics and exercises.

ðŸ’¡ Have ideas for other topics or tools to include? We welcome suggestions! Please [post an issue on the lesson's GitHub repository](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/fair-explainable-ml/issues).

### Topics covered
1. **Fairness**: Hands-on bias detection and mitigation using AIF360.
2. **Explainability**: Techniques such as GradCAM and linear probes for visualizing model behavior.
3. **Safety and Reliability**: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection with PyTorch-OOD.
4. **Trustworthiness**: Ensuring models are interpretable, reproducible, and aligned with ethical practices.

#### Prerequisites
Learners should have:

- Python programming experience.
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts like train/test splits and cross-validation.
- Exposure to neural networks and basic model training.

#### Estimated time to complete
This workshop takes approximately 12 hours, divided across multiple hands-on episodes.

### Register to take this workshop in Madison!
This workshop is part of UW-Madison's [local Carpentries community](https://datascience.wisc.edu/uw-madison-carpentries-community/) efforts to develop advanced ML/AI educational materials. To stay updated about upcoming workshops, subscribe to the [Data Science @ UW Newsletter](https://datascience.wisc.edu/newsletter/).

### Alternatively, work through the materials independently!
The full lesson is available as open-source materials. Visit the [lesson materials](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/fair-explainable-ml/) to explore on your own. If you're at UW-Madison, join [Coding Meetup](https://datascience.wisc.edu/hub/#dropin) (Tue/Thur, 2:30-4:30pm) for assistance.
