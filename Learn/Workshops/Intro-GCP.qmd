## About this resource
This [Intro to GCP](https://qualiamachine.github.io/Intro_GCP_for_ML/) workshop teaches core workflows for building, training, and tuning ML/AI models in Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform. Participants learn to set up data, configure Vertex AI Workbench notebooks, launch training and tuning jobs, and optimize resource costs effectively within GCP. The workshop also includes a section on building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines using Gemini models. 

#### Cost estimate
Running through this workshop should cost approximately **$3–$8** on GCP, assuming short GPU runs and limited hyperparameter tuning trials. Using `n2-standard-4` or `e2-standard-4` instances with a single T4 GPU generally stays within this range. New accounts may be eligible for **$300 in free GCP credits**, which typically cover the full cost of this workshop. It is recommended to track usage in the [GCP Billing Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) and delete unused resources once completed.

#### Prerequisites
- [**Workshop**: Intro to Machine Learning](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Learn/Workshops/Intro-ML_Sklearn.html)
- [**Workshop**: Basic Python Programming](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Learn/Workshops/Intro-Python_Gapminder.html)

#### Estimated time to complete
**4–6 hours**: Based on running through training, tuning, and the Gemini RAG pipeline example.
