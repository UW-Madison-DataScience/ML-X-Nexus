## About this resource
The [Intro to Deep Learning with Keras](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/deep-learning-intro/) workshop will walk you through introductory deep learning concepts as well as how to build a neural networks in Keras. Keras is high-level wrapper framework (uses PyTorch or Tensorflow in the backend) which allows you to train and evaluate neural networks in just a few lines of code. It may take slightly longer to train a Keras model (compared to PyTorch and Tensorflow), but the difference in performance is often negligible for those that only need to train a few models. The ability to quickly build and test models is the primary selling point of Keras.

#### Prerequisites
Learners are expected to have the following knowledge:

- Basic Python programming skills and familiarity with the Pandas package. If you need a refresher, these [Introductory Python](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Learn/Workshops/Intro-Python_Gapminder.html) lesson materials are available for independent study.
- Basic knowledge on machine learning, including the following concepts: Data cleaning, train & test split, type of problems (regression, classification), overfitting & underfitting, metrics (accuracy, recall, etc.).The [Intro to Machine Learning with Sklearn](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Learn/Workshops/Intro-ML_Sklearn.html) lesson materials are a good option for those that need a refresher on machine learning fundamentals.

#### Estimated time to complete
This workshop takes approximately 15 hours to complete. 

### Register to take this workshop in Madison!
The Carpentries is a global organization of researchers who volunteer their time and effort to create workshops that teach software engineering and data analysis skills to other researchers. UW-Madison has its own [local Carpentries community](https://datascience.wisc.edu/uw-madison-carpentries-community/) which is actively engaged in developing new ML/AI workshops. To be notified of upcoming workshops offered by the Carpentries, make sure to subscribe to the [Data Science @ UW Newsletter](https://datascience.wisc.edu/newsletter/). The Intro Deep Learning workshop is typically taught in May each year.

### Alternatively, work through the materials independently!
All Carpentries lessons are published as open source educational materials. You are welcome and encouraged to visit the [lesson materials](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/deep-learning-intro/) to work through them on your own. If you are involved with a research lab at UW-Madison campus, you may attend [Coding Meetup](https://datascience.wisc.edu/hub/#dropin) (Tue/Thur, 2:30-4:30pm) to get help working through the materials.

## Questions?
If you any lingering questions about this resource, please feel free to post to the [Nexus Q&A](https://github.com/UW-Madison-DataScience/ML-X-Nexus/discussions/categories/q-a) on GitHub. We will improve materials on this website as additional questions come in.
