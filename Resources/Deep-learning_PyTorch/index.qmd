## About this external resource

Udacity offers many free educational materials focused on tech-related topics. The [Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188) workshop from Udacity will walk you through introductory deep learning concepts as well as how to build a neural networks in PyTorch. PyTorch is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks. Known for its speed and more "Pythonic" feel, it is frequently the go-to choice for most researchers. The biggest downside of PyTorch, compared to a high-level framework like Keras, is that it is quite verbose. That is, you'll need to write a couple hundred lines of code to train and evaluate your neural network. Keras is a great alternative for those who are just getting started with neural networks or those that don't need to train many models, as you can train/evaluate in just a dozen or so lines of code.

- [**Book**: Understanding Deep Learning - Simon J.D. Prince](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/): This free textbook is a good modern overview of deep learning, and provides colab notebooks to explore deep learning concepts and implementations. The book uses PyTorch as its framework of choice. You may find additional details in this book that the workshop only briefly touches on.
