## About this resource
The [Plotting and Programming in Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) workshop provides an introduction to programming in Python 3 for people with little or no previous programming experience. It uses plotting as its motivating example to learn Python fundamentals, including functions, conditional logic, loops, and popular packages (e.g., Pandas).

#### Prerequisites
No previous experience with programming necessary.

#### Estimated time to complete
This workshop takes approximately 8 hours to complete. 

### Register to take this workshop in Madison!
The Carpentries is a global organization of researchers who volunteer their time and effort to create workshops that teach software engineering and data analysis skills to other researchers. UW-Madison has its own [local Carpentries community](https://datascience.wisc.edu/uw-madison-carpentries-community/) which is actively engaged in developing new ML/AI workshops. To be notified of upcoming workshops offered by the Carpentries, make sure to subscribe to the [Data Science @ UW Newsletter](https://datascience.wisc.edu/newsletter/). 

### Alternatively, work through the materials independently!
All Carpentries lessons are published as open source educational materials. You are welcome and encouraged to visit the [lesson materials](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/machine-learning-novice-sklearn/) to work through them on your own. If you are involved with a research lab at UW-Madison campus, you may attend [Coding Meetup](https://datascience.wisc.edu/hub/#dropin) (Tue/Thur, 2:30-4:30pm) to get help working through the materials.

## Questions?
If you any lingering questions about this resource, please feel free to post to the [Nexus Q&A](https://github.com/UW-Madison-DataScience/ML-X-Nexus/discussions/categories/q-a) on GitHub. We will improve materials on this website as additional questions come in.
