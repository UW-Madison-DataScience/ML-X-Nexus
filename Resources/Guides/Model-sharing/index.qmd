# Model Sharing Via Hugging Face’s [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models)


## Links

* Model Hub: [https://huggingface.co/models](https://huggingface.co/models)

## Navigating Model Hub



* Navigating the Model Hub: [https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/models-the-hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/models-the-hub) 
* Models are uploaded with tags associated with
    * task
    * library (PyTorch, Tensorflow, etc.)
    * training data
    * language (english, spanish, etc.)
    * license
* Clicking a model will show you its model card 


## Model Cards



* See: [https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/model-cards](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/model-cards) and [https://huggingface.co/blog/model-cards](https://huggingface.co/blog/model-cards) 
* The information included in any given model cards is, unfortunately, not well standardized. However, it is best practice to include at least the following pieces of information
    * **Info on base model (e.g., if your model is finetuned)**
    * **Info on common model variations**
        * Help others understand your model within the context of recent developments
    * **Model description**
        * general purpose
        * architecture
    * **Info on training data**
        * How the data was collected
        * Data license and usage terms
        * Basic descriptive statistics: number of samples, features, classes, etc. Describe and/or visualize data distribution.
        * Note any class imbalance issues. Include assessments of bias and fairness, when possible. 
            * **Example**: The training dataset used for the facial recognition model might unintentionally be biased, containing predominantly images of people from certain demographic groups (e.g., predominantly light-skinned individuals).
    * **The model’s evaluation results**
    * **Intended uses and limitations**
        * This is critical for all models, but especially models that can have a downstream impact on people.
        * **Example**: If the model is not designed to handle diverse demographics, it may learn patterns that favor certain groups while performing poorly on others. In this case, the model may have higher accuracy for light-skinned individuals but lower accuracy for darker-skinned individuals.


## Uploading a Model



* Uploading a model to Hugging Face: [https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/models-uploading](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/models-uploading) 
* All models are stored as GitHub repositories
* Some frameworks (e.g., PyTorch) have integrations that make it straightforward to upload a model within your model training script
* You get to decide what information and metadata you want to include in the GitHub repository


## Open Questions



1. Is there any way to help control the overall coding environment when sharing a model? For instance, if my goal is to reproduce paper results _exactly_ rather than repurpose a model. 
2. How documented should my data be within my model card? Should I save the details for a separate “data card”?
3. If you already have a convenient way to download and load models stored elsewhere (e.g. Zenodo), how much additional benefit is there to refactoring your code to use Hugging Face to host the models?
4. What is involved in running an interactive demo on the Hugging Face website with your model?
