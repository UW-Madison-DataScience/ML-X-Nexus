# You will need to add a representative image to the ML-X-Nexus/images folder.
# - If posting a paper, please use a representative figure from the paper:
  # image: "../../../images/2017_AttentionIsAllYouNeed_Vaswani.png"
  
# - If posting a video from YouTube, follow these instructions to use the "thumbnail" image from the video. 
  #  1) Identify the YouTube video ID: The video ID is the unique identifier for each YouTube video, usually found 
  #     after the "v=" parameter in the URL. For example, in the URL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ, the video ID is dQw4w9WgXcQ.
  
  #  2) Construct the thumbnail URL: YouTube provides different resolutions for video thumbnails. Here are the formats for different resolutions. We'll use the maximum resolution.
  #     Maximum resolution thumbnail: https://img.youtube.com/vi/[VIDEO_ID]/maxresdefault.jpg. Replace [VIDEO_ID] with the actual video ID, removing the square brackets.
  # image: "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dQw4w9WgXcQ/maxresdefault.jpg"
