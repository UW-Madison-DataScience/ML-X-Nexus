Please check out the tags which are already being used on Nexus by visiting https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Learn/ and looking under "Categories". Avoid repeating tags with alternative spelling (e.g., use Deep Learning rather than DL since Deep Learning is already being used.). 
# Example categories below:
categories: 
  - Deep learning # Deep learning, Regression, Large language models, NLP, Clustering, Decision trees, etc.
  - PyTorch # PyTorch, Keras, Tensorflow, Sklearn, etc.
  - Workshops # Workshops, Books, Podcasts, Videos, Blogs, Models, Datasets, EDA, etc.
  - Code-along # Include this tag for any resource that involves coding along as a learning mechanism (e.g., workshop, short demo/guide with code examples)
