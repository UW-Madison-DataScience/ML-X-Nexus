# You will need to add a representative image to the ML-X-Nexus/images folder.
  
# - If posting a video from YouTube, follow these instructions to use the "thumbnail" image from the video. 
  #  1) Identify the YouTube video ID: The video ID is the unique identifier for each YouTube video, usually found 
  #     after the "v=" parameter in the URL. For example, in the URL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ, the video ID is dQw4w9WgXcQ.
  
  #  2) Construct the thumbnail URL: YouTube provides different resolutions for video thumbnails. Here are the formats for different resolutions. We'll use the maximum resolution.
  #     Maximum resolution thumbnail: https://img.youtube.com/vi/[VIDEO_ID]/maxresdefault.jpg. Replace [VIDEO_ID] with the actual video ID, removing the square brackets.
  # image: "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dQw4w9WgXcQ/maxresdefault.jpg"
image: "https://img.youtube.com/vi/[VIDEO_ID]/maxresdefault.jpg"

# - Else, add a representative image to the repo's images folder (with creative commons license). A screenshot of a slidedeck (title slide) can always fill in.
image: "../../../images/my_image.jpg" # delete if using youtube thumbnail image

# Enter a list of relevant categories/tags for this resource, including the type (workshop, book, video, podcast, etc.) topic of focus, and anything else that might be relevant. Please check out the tags which are already being used on Nexus by visiting https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Learn/ and looking under "Categories". Avoid repeating tags with alternative spelling (e.g., use Deep Learning rather than DL since Deep Learning is already being used.). 
# Example categories below:
categories: 
  - Deep learning # Deep learning, Regression, Large language models, NLP, Clustering, Decision trees, etc.
  - PyTorch # PyTorch, Keras, Tensorflow, Sklearn, etc.
  - Workshops # Workshops, Books, Podcasts, Videos, Blogs, Models, Datasets, EDA, etc.
  - Code-along # Include this tag for any resource that involves coding along as a learning mechanism (e.g., workshop, short demo/guide with code examples)
