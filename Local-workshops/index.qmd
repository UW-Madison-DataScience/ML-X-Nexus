Please see below for workshops taught locally at UW-Madison. To stay up-to-date on any new workshop offerings, we recommend subscribing to the [Data Science @ UW newsletter](https://datascience.wisc.edu/newsletter/).

Most workshops listed have open source lesson materials which you are encouraged to independently study. If you are involved with a research lab on campus, you may attend [Coding Meetup](https://datascience.wisc.edu/hub/#dropin) (Tue/Thur, 2:30-4:30pm) to get help working through the materials.
