## About this resource
Hosted by the ML+X community, this monthly forum event highlights two machine learning (ML) applications that share a theme (e.g., computer vision, time-series analysis, generative models, LLMs, bias and ethics, etc.) followed by communal discussions and project feedback. Whether you’re a beginner or seasoned expert in ML, participating in the ML+X forum can help you stay informed on:

- best practices and limitations of ML
- recent developments in ML including new models, tools, and theory
- methods to efficiently deploy & maintain ML systems (“MLOps”)
- ethical considerations of ML and impact on society

The Nexus platform maintains a full playlist of past forums found under [Highlights](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Applications/Highlights/Forums/).

## Join the next live forum!
