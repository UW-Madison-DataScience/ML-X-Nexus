## About this resource
The [Systems, Information, Learning and Optimization (SILO)](https://silo.wisc.edu/) research group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison hosts a weekly seminar that covers a variety of topics related to machine learning, optimization, and information theory. SILO breaks down the research “silos” created by academic department boundaries by providing time and space for researchers to present their work, interact, and find common threads.
