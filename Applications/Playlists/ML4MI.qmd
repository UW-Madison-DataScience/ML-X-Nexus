## About this resource
From the [Machine Learning for Medical Imaging (ML4MI)](https://ml4mi.wisc.edu/learning-opportunities/) webpage:

> A regular seminar series began in February 2018, and includes 1) seminars describing technical developments in ML with potential biomedical applications, 2) seminars by local or external Radiology researchers, describing problems that may benefit from ML approaches and ongoing projects involving ML techniques, and 3) seminars by biomedical researchers (not in Radiology), describing pioneering experiences applying ML in their fields of study. The seminar location will alternate between ECB/WID and SMPH/WIMR. These seminars will also provide an opportunity for UW researchers to become familiar with researchers “on the other side of campus.” Recordings of past seminars are available on our [MediaSpace Channel](https://mediaspace.wisc.edu/channel/Machine%2BLearning%2Bfor%2BMedical%2BImaging%2B%2528ML4MI%2529%2BSeminar%2BSeries/355339002) (UW NetID required).

**Note**: To access the videos, you will need to be a UW-Madison affiliate with a netID.
