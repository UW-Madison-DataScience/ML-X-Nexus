Explore our library of ML+X forum recordings below! Each monthly ML+X forum highlights two ML applications that share a theme followed by communal discussions and project feedback.

* **Where**: Orchard View Room (rm. 3280), [Discovery Building](https://www.map.wisc.edu/?initObj=0212) & via Zoom. Join the [Google group](https://groups.google.com/a/g-groups.wisc.edu/g/ml-community-of-practice) to receive a calendar invite (with Zoom link) and other updates.
* **When**: Monthly on Tuesdays, 12-1pm CT. Check the [ML+X website](https://hub.datascience.wisc.edu/communities/mlx/#forums) for the exact schedule each semester.

#### Share Your Work! 
We encourage anyone who is using ML in their work to present at one of the ML+X forums. If interested, please fill out this brief [presenter sign-up form](https://forms.gle/dsaKNTgQofqFQX9N9).
