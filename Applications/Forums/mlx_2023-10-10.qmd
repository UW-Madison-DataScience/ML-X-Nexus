Hosted by UW-Madison's [ML+X Community](https://datascience.wisc.edu/ml-community), each monthly forum highlights two machine learning applications that share a theme followed by communal discussions.

1. Computational Methods for Comparative Time Clocks in Early Development and Tissue Regeneration, Peng Jiang

2. Controlled Differential Equations on Long Sequences via Non-standard Wavelets, Sourav Pal
