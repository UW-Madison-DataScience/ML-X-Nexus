Hosted by UW-Madison's [ML+X Community](https://datascience.wisc.edu/ml-community), each monthly forum highlights two machine learning applications that share a theme followed by communal discussions.

1. An ultrasound-based method to measure knee kinematics enabled by deep learning, Matthew Blomquist

2. Plant breeding in the age of computer vision, Will de la Bretonne
