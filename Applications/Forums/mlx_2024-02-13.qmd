Hosted by UW-Madison's [ML+X community](https://datascience.wisc.edu/ml-community), each monthly forum highlights two machine learning applications that share a theme followed by communal discussions.

1. Welcome and small group discussions (discussion activity removed from recording), Chris Endemann

2. Classifying gravitational wave modes from core-collapse supernovae, Bella Finkel, [1:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmKMhNiu5Fw&list=PL90vX4e9ORqc8ZB1uL_gtLFFZc093m4CQ&index=5&t=94s)
