Hosted by UW-Madison's [ML+X community](https://datascience.wisc.edu/ml-community), each monthly forum highlights two machine learning applications that share a theme followed by communal discussions.

1. GPT for Science Communication: User-Interface and Developer Pipeline Approaches, Ben Rush, [0:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xcsr0mKj4A&list=PL90vX4e9ORqc8ZB1uL_gtLFFZc093m4CQ&index=4&t=10s)

2. Advancing Biomedical Research with GPT-4: A Novel Approach to Drug Synergy Analysis using Text Mining and Classification, Jack Freeman, [27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xcsr0mKj4A&list=PL90vX4e9ORqc8ZB1uL_gtLFFZc093m4CQ&index=4&t=1678s)
