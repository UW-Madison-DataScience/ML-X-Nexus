# You will need to add a representative image to the ML-X-Nexus/images folder.
  
# - OPTION 1: If posting a video from YouTube, follow these instructions to use the "thumbnail" image from the video. 
  #  1) Identify the YouTube video ID: The video ID is the unique identifier for each YouTube video, usually found 
  #     after the "v=" parameter in the URL. For example, in the URL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ, the video ID is dQw4w9WgXcQ.
  
  #  2) Construct the thumbnail URL: YouTube provides different resolutions for video thumbnails. Here are the formats for different resolutions. We'll use the maximum resolution.
  #     Maximum resolution thumbnail: https://img.youtube.com/vi/[VIDEO_ID]/maxresdefault.jpg. Replace [VIDEO_ID] with the actual video ID, removing the square brackets.
  # image: "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dQw4w9WgXcQ/maxresdefault.jpg"

image: "../../../images/color-crest-red-bg.png" # replace VIDEO_ID with youtube video ID. 

# - OPTION 2: If it's not a video from YouTube, you'll have to generate/acquire your own image. You could take a screenshot of the video's title slide (assuming video is public) or use genAI to create a relevant image.
  
#image: "../../../images/my_unique_image.png" # uncomment out this line if you're using a custom image. Adjust filename to your file name. Place image in the images folder in the repo.

# Leave as is

# Enter a list of relevant categories/tags for this resource, including the type (talk, video, paper, etc.) topic of focus, and anything else that might be relevant. Please check out the tags which are already being used on Nexus by visiting https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Applications/ and looking under "Categories". Avoid repeating tags with alternative spelling (e.g., use Deep Learning rather than DL since Deep Learning is already being used.). 
# Example categories below:
categories:
  - Videos # Always include
  - Exploring AI@UW # Name of talk series (e.g., ML+X, IT Prof)
  - UW-Madison # If talk is UW-Madison affiliated, include this
  - Healthcare # Domain or application area (e..g, genomics, Agriculture, Physics, Science Communication, Neurosicence, etc.)
  - Medical imaging
  - Image classification # specific dataset/subdomain descriptor 
  # Method descriptors: You can come up with new ones that aren't already listed on Nexus if you think it is needed. Lean towards including more rather than less; reviewers can always tirm the fat. Examples:
  - Computer vision # Descriptor 1 (e.g., Computer vision, NLP, Tabular)
  - Deep learning # Classical ML

### About this resource
Dr. Alan McMillan discusses the growing role of AI and machine learning in healthcare, particularly in radiology and medical imaging. He outlines how AI is being applied in tasks such as classification, regression, and segmentation, helping to enhance efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, and clinical decision-making. However, he also emphasizes current challenges, including ensuring HIPAA compliance, managing legal liability, and addressing algorithmic bias and poor robustness. The conversation also explores technical considerations like research reporting guidelines and interpretability of deep neural networks, as well as current radiology research on campus at UW-Madison utilizing AI. 
<!-- MARKDOWN COMMENT:  Finally, replace the URL below with your video's URL. -->.
