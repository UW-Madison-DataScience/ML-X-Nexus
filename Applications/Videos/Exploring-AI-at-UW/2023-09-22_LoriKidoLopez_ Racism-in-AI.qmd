### About this resource

Lori Kido Lopez, UW–Madison professor and author of "[Race and Digital Media"](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Race+and+Digital+Media%3A+An+Introduction-p-9781509546923)" discusses how histories of institutionalized racism in big data, tech industries and society are shaping AI today.
