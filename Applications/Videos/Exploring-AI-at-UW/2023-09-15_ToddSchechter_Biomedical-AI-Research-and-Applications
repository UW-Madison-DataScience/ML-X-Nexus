### About this resource
> This session features lightning talks about biomedical applications of artificial intelligence from UW–Madison researchers working to develop algorithms and models to help us better understand the human body, improve communication and create treatments that improve and save lives.
>
> This is the 12th installment in the Exploring AI@UW seires. You can learn more about the series, catch up on past seminars, and see what we have planned next on our “[Exploring Artificial Intelligence @ UW–Madison](https://it.wisc.edu/generative-ai-services-uw-madison/exploring-artificial-intelligence-uw-madison/)” page.
