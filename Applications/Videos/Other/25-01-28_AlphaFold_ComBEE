# You will need to add a representative image to the ML-X-Nexus/images folder.
  
# - OPTION 1: If posting a video from YouTube, follow these instructions to use the "thumbnail" image from the video. 
  #  1) Identify the YouTube video ID: The video ID is the unique identifier for each YouTube video, usually found 
  #     after the "v=" parameter in the URL. For example, in the URL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ, the video ID is dQw4w9WgXcQ.
  
  #  2) Construct the thumbnail URL: YouTube provides different resolutions for video thumbnails. Here are the formats for different resolutions. We'll use the maximum resolution.
  #     Maximum resolution thumbnail: https://img.youtube.com/vi/[VIDEO_ID]/maxresdefault.jpg. Replace [VIDEO_ID] with the actual video ID, removing the square brackets.
  # image: "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dQw4w9WgXcQ/maxresdefault.jpg"

image: "https://img.youtube.com/vi/DxugLHvQzSw/maxresdefault.jpg" # replace VIDEO_ID with youtube video ID. 

# - OPTION 2: If it's not a video from YouTube, you'll have to generate/acquire your own image. You could take a screenshot of the video's title slide (assuming video is public) or use genAI to create a relevant image.
  
#image: "../../../images/my_unique_image.png" # uncomment out this line if you're using a custom image. Adjust filename to your file name. Place image in the images folder in the repo.

# Leave as is

### About this resource
In a talk hosted by the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Computational Biology, Ecology, and Evolution (ComBEE) community, Dr. Hannah Wayment-Steele discusses AlphaFold, an model developed by DeepMind that predicts protein structures from amino acid sequences, along with other similar proten language models ESM and EvoFormer. Wayment-Steele describes the model's architecture,  applications in structural biology, and current pitfalls such as with isoforms.
**Bio**: Dr. Hannah Wayment-Steele is a assistant professor at UW Madison with a PHD in chemistry from Standford. Her lab focus on  biomolecular dynamics and mechanisms that underlie biological function and shape evolution, bringing together the fields of data science, deep learning, and NMR spectroscopy.
