# You will need to add a representative image to the ML-X-Nexus/images folder.
  
# - If posting a video from YouTube, follow these instructions to use the "thumbnail" image from the video. 
  #  1) Identify the YouTube video ID: The video ID is the unique identifier for each YouTube video, usually found 
  #     after the "v=" parameter in the URL. For example, in the URL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ, the video ID is dQw4w9WgXcQ.
  
  #  2) Construct the thumbnail URL: YouTube provides different resolutions for video thumbnails. Here are the formats for different resolutions. We'll use the maximum resolution.
  #     Maximum resolution thumbnail: https://img.youtube.com/vi/[VIDEO_ID]/maxresdefault.jpg. Replace [VIDEO_ID] with the actual video ID, removing the square brackets.
  # image: "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dQw4w9WgXcQ/maxresdefault.jpg"

# Enter a list of relevant categories/tags for this resource, including the type (talk, video, paper, etc.) topic of focus, and anything else that might be relevant. Please check out the tags which are already being used on Nexus by visiting https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Applications/ and looking under "Categories". Avoid repeating tags with alternative spelling (e.g., use Deep Learning rather than DL since Deep Learning is already being used.). 
# Example categories below:
categories:
  - Talks # Papers, Blogs 
  - Multimodal learning # Computer vision, NLP, Tabular
  - Deep learning # Classical ML
  - LLaVA # specific foundation models (e.g., GPT-3, ViT), if relevant
  - LMM # Decision tree, LSTM, LMM, CNN, CNN-LSTM (general model type)
  - Transfer learning # Other misc. ML topics highlighted, e.g., Contrastive learning, Dim. reduction
  - Healthcare # Genomics, Agriculture, Physics, Science Communication, Neurosicence, etc.
  - Ultrasound # specific dataset/subdomain descriptor 
  
# Provide a short description of the talk and why you think it may be useful to others. 
description: "This talk delves into the integration of multimodal data to better understand the complexities of brain function and associated diseases. It is particularly useful for researchers working in neuroscience and genomics."
    
#Note: If there are multiple presenters, please format the description as follows:
# description: |
#  1. Multimodal learning and analysis for understanding single-cell functional genomics in brains and brain diseases<br>
#  2. Transforming healthcare: AI-enhanced disease quantification with vision-language models<br>
#  3. The benefits of early fusion: deeply integrated audio-visual representation learning
  
# Finally, replace the URL below with your video's URL.
