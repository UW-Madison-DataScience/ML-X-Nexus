### Key Points
clinical deterioration in pediatric patients
- 16,000 children per year suffer in-hospital cardiac arrests
about 100,000 pediatric patients undergo deterioration cardiopulmonary compicattiper yaer
- high risk of mortality
- poor long-term health

What happens when a pediatric ward patient deteriorates?
- patient starts to deteriorate -> decline is recognized _> pediatric Emergency team (PET) activated 0> PET arrives and decides if patient should be transferred to ICU
- the problem is that decline is not always recognized/obvious
- Various early warning measurements (e.g., Bedside PEWS score): Given their age, consider heart rate, blood presurre, respriatory rate, and othe measurements. There are age-dependent cutoffs which are not sensitive enough to indivdual cases.There are also subjective components
- in 2018, Parshuram et al., looked at efficacy of pediatric early warning system (large randomized clinical trial involving 21 hostials and 144,000 patients). PEWS was not reliable. # revisit this to add some detail
- can ML help? A prediction model using vitals predicts direct ward-to-ICU transfers (simple logistic model). This vital sign model was more accurate than the Bedside PEWS measurement. 
- Can we improve performance of this model? 
- Used discrete-time survival analysis. Will patient be admitted to ICU within 12 hours?
- Missing value imputation performed using last observed carry forward folowed by median iputation
- Site1: 2009-2017 used to train. Validation: 2018-2019
- Site2: external test cohort
- from logistic regression with regularization to cubic splines to gradient boosted trees, performance improves.
- call their model pCART, which stands for... #
- pCART detect clinical events better than modified BesidePEWs
- pCART can be utilized as a means for a more efficient healthcare intervention
- implemented pCART at UChicago in April 2021
- after a couple of years of implementing pCARD, how did we do? Analyze pre/post data (2 years prior implementation, 2 years post)
  - criticalevents per 100 patients: mean 1.4 (pre), mean 0.4 (post). Implementaion was assocaited w/ decreased adverse events among high-risk children. 
- some discussion of how this was implemented to get newer data during the implementation
- discussion on the importance of longitudinal testing. How well does the model perform each year, given evolving clinical practices? What level of performance is acceptable?
- how can we further improve pediatric outcomes?
  - hospital-wide risk prediction of critical events (e.g., mechanical ventialation). Can we build a hospital-wide pediatric detrioration prediction model?
    - using critical events as an outcome since transfer to ICU can be subjective
    - continuus tracking of deterioration risk throughout a patient's journey
    - unified score is better than siloed scores. Different sections (ED, ward, ICU) will have different risk scores. Unified score simplifies communication and may improve outcomes.
    - challenge: patients in these different regions may represent distinct distributions
    - all prediatric admissions to Comer Children's hospital from 2009-2019, Loyola Medical Center from 2006-2020, and AmFm Children's hospital from 2009-2021. 
    - pCART still does better than BedsidePEWS. XGBoost does best.  XGBoost with RNN and RNN does not outperform XGBoost. The combined model actually out-performs the location-specific models
    - incorporate model explainers: variable importance plot, shapley values
- Methods to mine clinical notes: explaining pCART alerts through clinical text
- at time t, Recorded data (e.g., vitals/labs)-> pCART -> High risk alert (yes/no)
- at time t-12h, t: Unstructured clinical text -> CUI representations -> pCART explainer
- high risk informs pCART explainer as well

Conclusions
- we developed a model to predicut ICU transfers in children admitted to the ward. IMplementation of our model led to improved pediatric outcomes
