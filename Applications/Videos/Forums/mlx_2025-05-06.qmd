## About this resource

This ML+X Forum brings together two UW–Madison researchers exploring different ways generative AI can support critical workflows—whether surfacing surprising trends in health data or enhancing learning environments through customized tools.

### LLMs as data scientists  
**Benjamin Lengerich** (Statistics & Computer Sciences) shares a framework for automating surprise detection in electronic health records using generalized additive models (GAMs). These interpretable models decompose clinical features into univariate effects, which are then passed to LLMs to identify unexpected trends. Examples include counter-causal mortality patterns linked to biomarkers affected by treatment decisions. His team compares LLM-detected anomalies with human clinicians, proposing a hybrid system to support safer medical modeling. Several examples draw from both proprietary hospital data and the public **MIMIC-IV** dataset.

### LLMs in the classroom  
**Kaiser Pister** (Computer Sciences) describes how he built a retrieval-augmented chatbot for his programming languages course using lecture transcripts and Whisper-generated summaries. Students used the tool to ask questions, retrieve course content, and generate examples. He outlines a new direction where students “teach” an LLM a concept as a way to reinforce learning—turning the act of prompting into a pedagogical exercise.

### Why this matters  
This forum highlights concrete strategies for pairing interpretable models with LLMs in settings where safety, transparency, and human oversight are essential. Both talks demonstrate that modular statistical tools and responsible prompting can turn LLMs into powerful, trustworthy collaborators.
