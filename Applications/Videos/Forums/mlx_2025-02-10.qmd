Contrastive learning is reshaping how models learn, driving widespread progress in feature learning, clustering, out-of-distribution detection, and multimodal applications. Instead of relying on rigid classifications for model training, contrastive learning helps models recognize nuanced patterns and relationships in data, making them more adaptable and better at handling real-world data. In this forum, we explore how contrastive learning works, why it's effective, and how you can apply it in your own projects.
