# GitHub Actions Workflow: Check for Broken Links on GitHub Pages Site
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file defines a GitHub Actions *workflow* — a full automation process.
# It includes triggers (when it runs), and jobs (what it does).
#
# Inside the job, we *use an action* — a reusable piece of automation that handles 
# one task (in this case, link checking).
#
# Reminder: Workflows are made up of jobs, and jobs are made up of steps. 
# Steps often *use actions*, which are prebuilt helper tools.

name: Check for broken links  # Workflow name (appears in GitHub's Actions UI)

on:
  # Allows this workflow to be run manually from the GitHub UI
  workflow_dispatch:

  # Automatically run this workflow *after* the GitHub Pages site has been built and deployed.
  # The `pages-build-deployment` workflow is automatically created by GitHub when Pages is enabled.
  workflow_run:
    workflows:
      - pages-build-deployment
    types:
      - completed  # Only trigger after that deployment workflow finishes

  # Scheduled run using cron syntax (minute hour day month weekday)
  schedule:
    - cron: '49 11 * * 1'  # Run every Monday at 11:49 UTC (6:49 AM CDT)

# Job: A self-contained unit of work run on a specific virtual machine (runner).

jobs:
  crawl_for_broken_links:
    # Specify the operating system environment where this job runs.
    # This is required — GitHub needs to know which kind of runner to use.

    # `ubuntu-latest` is the most common and has many pre-installed tools.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Optional display name (helpful if your workflow has multiple jobs)
