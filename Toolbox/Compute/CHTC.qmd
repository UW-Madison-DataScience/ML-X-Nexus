## About this resource
Established in 2006, the [Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC)](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/) is committed to democratizing access to powerful computing resources across all research domains. From their website:
> We are the University of Wisconsin-Madison's core computational service provider for large scale computing. CHTC services are open to UW-Madison staff, students, faculty, and external collaborators.
> We offer both a High Throughput Computing system and a High Performance Computing cluster. Access to CPUs/GPUs, high-memory servers, data storage capacity, as well as personalized consultations and classroom support, are provided at no-cost.

Are you a researcher at UW-Madison seeking to extend your computing capabilities beyond local resources, particularly for machine learning tasks?  [Request an account now](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/uw-research-computing/form.html) to take advantage of the open computing services offered by the CHTC! 

### Run machine learning jobs on CHTC — GPUs available
This [guide](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/uw-research-computing/machine-learning-htc) provides some of our recommendations for success in running machine learning (specifically deep learning) jobs in CHTC. If you need help leveraging any of the CHTC resources, please reach out to [chtc@cs.wisc.edu](mailto:chtc@cs.wisc.edu).
