## About this resource

The **Leaf Vein Dataset 2021 (LVD2021)**, introduced in the paper [Leaf vein segmentation with self-supervision](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168169922006603), contains high-resolution images of leaves with pixel-wise annotations of vein structures. This dataset can be used to develop machine learning models for leaf vein segmentation and plant phenotyping. The dataset includes **4977 images** across **36 different types of leaves**, with over 100 images per type. The pixel-level annotations make it suitable for training models for fine-grained segmentation tasks. To request access to the **Leaf Vein Dataset 2021 (LVD2021)**, please fill out the [request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSflrJTabnsFd7KjLpu4yBJkKg2yimDdjrYU3Hmd_gJiKstXxQ/viewform). 

This dataset is particularly useful for:
- Leaf vein segmentation for ecological and genetic research.
- Automated identification of plant species based on vein architecture.
- Morphological analysis of plant traits such as total vein length, density, and branching structure.

#### Key features
- **High-resolution images**: Each image in the dataset is 2736x3648 pixels, providing detailed views of leaf structures.
- **Pixel-wise annotations**: Each leaf image comes with annotations that precisely mark the vein architecture, enabling fine-grained segmentation.
- **Variety of leaf types**: The dataset covers a wide range of plant species, allowing for diverse research opportunities in botany and plant phenotyping.

#### Key applications 
- **Leaf vein segmentation**: Develop models to extract vein features such as vein continuity, branching, and intersections. Models like [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) or [DeepLabV3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05587) can be adapted for this task.
- **Plant phenotyping**: Analyze leaf vein characteristics, which are important for understanding water and nutrient transport in plants. This can be useful for ecological and environmental monitoring.
- **Self-supervised learning**: The dataset's fine annotations make it suitable for self-supervised learning techniques like pseudo-labeling, which allows models to be trained with only a small number of labeled samples.
- **Segmentation in noisy environments**: Develop segmentation models that can handle complex leaf images with indistinguishable mesophyll, breakpoints, and blurred vein boundaries.
