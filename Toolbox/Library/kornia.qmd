## About this Library

Kornia is a differentiable library that allows classical computer vision to be integrated into deep learning models. Developed by E. Riba, D. Mishkin, D. Ponsa, E. Rublee and G. Bradski and introduced in 2020, it is built on top of PyTorch to offer tools for image processing and transformer-based computer vision models.

#### Key features
- **Image Augmentation**: Standard image augmentation functionalities such as gaussian noise, random flips, and color jiggle.
- **Feature Detection**: Classical computer vision algorithms such hessian blobs, Harris corner detector, and difference of gaussians. Deep learning-based algorithms such as Dexined, KeyNet, DISK, and DeDoDe. 
- **Transformer Models**: Optimized transformers-based computer vision models such as SAM, ViT, LoFTR, and RT-DETR

## Integration and compatibility
Kornia is compatible with PyTorch and any libraries built on top of PyTorch. In addition, all features from Kornia can utilize the GPU of the host machine.

- **Frameworks Supported**: PyTorch, PyTorch-Lightning, and Fastai
- **Installation Instructions**: `pip install kornia`

## Use cases
Here are some examples of how Kornia can be applied to different machine learning tasks.

- **Image Preprocessing**: Apply the Shi-Tomasi cornerness function to preprocess images for 3D reconstruction.
- **Image Matching**: Apply the KeyNet algorithm to match images from different perspectives/angles.

## Tutorials and resources
