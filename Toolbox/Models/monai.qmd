## About this external resource

[MONAI](https://monai.io/index.html) (Medical Open Network for AI) is an open-source, community-supported framework for deep learning in healthcare imaging. Built on top of PyTorch, it provides specialized functionality for medical imaging tasks, including pre-trained models, data loaders, and evaluation metrics tailored for the medical domain. MONAI is particularly valuable for researchers and practitioners looking to leverage deep learning for medical imaging applications due to its flexibility, performance, and ease of integration with existing workflows.
