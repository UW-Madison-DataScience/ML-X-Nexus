## About this resource

MegaDetector is an AI model that identifies animals, people, and vehicles in camera trap images (which also makes it
useful for eliminating blank images). This model is trained on several million images from a variety of ecosystems.
Introduced in 2018 by Dan Morris, supported by Microsoft, via Sarah Beery in the paper "[The MegaDetector: Large-Scale Deployment of Computer Vision for Conservation and Biodiversity Monitoring](https://www.ai4sibook.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/MegaDetector.pdf)",
MegaDetector has become a widely used model for animal, human, and vehicle detection in camera trap images. It being
specifically trained on camera trap images allows it to excel in wildlife conservation filtering tasks. It is being used
in numerous conservation efforts, including at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) [Snapshot Wisconsin](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/research/projects/snapshot) trail camera project.


#### Key features
- **Architecture**: MegaDetector v5 is a pre-trained model that relies on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) v5 architecture.

## Timeline context
MegaDetector builds on advances in the YOLO family of object detection models and is widely adopted by researchers working with camera trap data.  

- **[YOLOv5 (2021)](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.20892v1)**: An updated framework base on the YOLO object detection model.
- **[YOLO (2015)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640)**: The initial introduction of the YOLO object
detection model.
