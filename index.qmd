Nexus is the [ML+X](https://datascience.wisc.edu/ml-community/) community’s centralized hub for sharing machine learning (ML) resources and blogs that help make the practice of ML in Madison more connected, accessible, efficient, and reproducible. 

### What kinds of resources are hosted on Nexus?

* 📜 [**Guides**](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Guides/): Explore a library of guides covering a wide range of ML-related topics, from foundational concepts to advanced techniques. Written by community members or sourced from external websites (e.g., Kaggle, YouTube), these guides offer clear explanations, practical examples, and actionable insights to help you navigate the complexities of ML with confidence.

* 🏆 [**ML Stories**](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/ML-stories/): Discover a curated collection of blogs which dive into real-world experiences and lessons learned by ML practitioners in the ML+X community.

* 🚀 [**Exploratory data analysis (EDA) case studies**](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/ML-stories/): As the adage goes, "garbage in, garbage out," emphasizing the critical role of EDA in ensuring the quality and integrity of any ML pipeline. These case studies offer firsthand experiences in navigating real-world datasets, demonstrating the technical steps and domain knowledge needed to explore different data types (time-series, tabular, images, etc.) from various fields.
