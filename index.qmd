More than just a repository of content from across the internet, ML+X Nexus is a curated, community-driven platform that captures the collective knowledge and experiences of [ML+X](https://datascience.wisc.edu/ml-community/) (and the broader UW campus). It serves as a growing knowledge hubâ€”preserving past discussions, highlighting widely used tools and datasets, and evolving alongside our community's needs.

### What kinds of resources are hosted on Nexus?

### Share your knowledge on Nexus!  
This site is powered by contributions from ML/AI practitioners. If you've found a tool, tutorial, dataset, or strategy that's helped you in your ML/AI work, consider adding it to Nexus so others can benefit too. Learn more on our [How to contribute](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Learn/Guides/How-to-contribute.html). page.

### Explore resources
To narrow down your search, select one of the general category groupings from the left sidebar (e.g.,  [Learn](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Learn/), [Applications](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Applications/), [Toolbox](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Toolbox/)). You can also select one of the category tags on the right sidebar to filter resources. Visit the [Category glossary](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/glossary.html) if you are unsure about the meaning of any of these tags.
