Nexus is the ML+X communityâ€™s centralized hub for sharing machine learning (ML) resources. Visit the [ML+X website](https://datascience.wisc.edu/ml-community/) to learn more about the community, and join the [ML+X google group](https://datascience.wisc.edu/ml-community/#join) to stay informed on upcoming community events (forums, workshops, socials, etc.)!

### Website in development
The official Nexus launch date is scheduled for 9/10/24. Check back then for more substantial updates!

### What kinds of resources are hosted on Nexus?
Any content (original or external) that can help make the practice of ML more connected, accessible, efficient, and reproducible is welcome on the Nexus platform! This includes, but is not limited to:


* ðŸ§  [**Educational materials**](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Resources/): Explore a library of educational materials (workshops, guides, books, videos, etc.) covering a wide range of ML-related topics, from foundational concepts to advanced techniques. Written by community members or sourced externally, these materials offer clear explanations, practical examples, and actionable insights to help you navigate the complexities of ML with confidence.

* ðŸ§¬ [**Applications & stories**](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Resources/Blogs/): Discover a curated collection of blogs, papers, and talks which dive into real-world experiences and lessons learned by ML practitioners.

* ðŸ“Š [**Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Resources/EDA-examples/): As the adage goes, "garbage in, garbage out," emphasizing the critical role of exploratory data analysis (EDA) in ensuring the quality and integrity of any ML pipeline. These case studies offer firsthand experiences in navigating real-world datasets, demonstrating the technical steps and domain knowledge needed to explore different data types (time-series, tabular, images, etc.) from various fields.

* ðŸ›  [**Data, models, and tools**](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Resources/): Explore a selection of useful datasets, pretrained and foundation models, and software tools that are essential for ML projects. Learn about their features, how to use them effectively, and see examples of them in action.


### Make a contribution to Nexus!
This website is a team effort! We welcome and encourage individuals to contribute their own ML resource, EDA example, or story to Nexus. For instructions on how to contribute, visit [How to contribute?](https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/ML-X-Nexus/Resources/Guides/How-to-contribute.html).
